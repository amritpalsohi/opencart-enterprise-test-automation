# OpenCart Automation Test Suite
📌 Overview

This repository contains an enterprise-grade automation framework designed to test the OpenCart e-commerce application across UI and API layers.
The framework is built with scalability, maintainability, and CI/CD readiness in mind, simulating real-world automation challenges found in production systems.

The goal of this project is not just test execution, but to demonstrate:

Framework architecture

Test design principles

Reliability handling

CI/CD integration

Realistic end-to-end workflows

🏗 Application Under Test (AUT)

OpenCart is an open-source e-commerce platform that closely resembles enterprise retail applications.

Why OpenCart?

Admin & Customer roles

Authentication & authorization

Product, cart, order workflows

CRUD-heavy business logic

🧠 Framework Design Highlights
✔ BDD with Cucumber

Feature files written in Gherkin

Business-readable scenarios

Strong collaboration between QA, Dev, and Product

Step definitions mapped to reusable actions

Example:
Scenario: Successful order placement by registered user
  Given user is logged into OpenCart
  When user adds a product to cart
  And completes checkout
  Then order should be created successfully

✔ Page Object Model (POM)

Page actions separated from step definitions

Improves reusability and readability

Simplifies maintenance when UI changes

✔ Test Runner Strategy

Cucumber + TestNG integration

Tag-based execution

Parallel execution support

Environment-based test selection


✔ Configuration Management

Environment-specific properties

Browser, URL, credentials configurable

No hard-coded values

🔍 Test Coverage
🖥 UI Automation (BDD)

Admin login & role validation

Product creation and management

Customer registration & login

Cart & checkout workflows

Order verification (Admin & Customer)

Negative & edge-case scenarios

🔗 API Automation (BDD)

Product and user CRUD operations

Request/response validation

Schema validation

Authorization handling

Data-driven scenarios

Negative API cases
